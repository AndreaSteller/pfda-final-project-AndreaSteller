#Snake

##[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndreaSteller/pfda-final-project-AndreaSteller.git)

###I will be making the classic google snake game through code.

###I plan to have a moving series of dots that you can control with the arrow keys or WASD
###I want a different color of dots to randomly appear (one at a time) like the apples that appear in the game.
###When the snake eats the apple another will appear. 
###I would like a counter to keep up with the amount of apples you 'eat'

###I would have to do more research on the counter. 
###I would also need to learn to more series of dots with keys

###I hope that this becomes a functional game that counts up all your score but I'd be happy if the snake and 
###collecting apples just work without the counter.

###1- create a series of dots that appear at a random position every time you load the game
###2- have the snake moving and eating the apples. Snake dies if it hits the edge?
###3- have a counter that prints something like "Congrats you got (Points) Points!"
