# Snake

## [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndreaSteller/pfda-final-project-AndreaSteller.git)

## Descripion
### I will be making the classic google snake game through code.

## Features
### +A moving series of dots that you can control with the arrow keys or WASD.
### +Different color dot to randomly appear like the apples that appear in the game.
### +When the snake eats the apple another will appear. 
### +A counter that keeps up with the amount of apples you 'eat'.

## Challenges
### +Counting system. 
### +System to move series of dots with keys.

## Outcomes
### I hope that this becomes a functional game that counts up your score, but I'd be happy if the snake and 
### apple collecting system work without the counter.

## Milestones
### 1.Create a series of dots that appear at a random position every time you load the game
### 1.Have the snake moving and eating the apples. Snake dies if it hits the edge?
### 1.Have a counter that prints something like "Congrats you got (Points) Points!"
