# Snake

### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndreaSteller/pfda-final-project-AndreaSteller.git)

### Descripion
#### I will be making the classic google snake game through code.

### Features
#### - A moving series of dots that you can control with the arrow keys or WASD.
#### - Different color dot to randomly appear like the apples that appear in the game.
#### - When the snake eats the apple another will appear. 
#### - A counter that keeps up with the amount of apples you 'eat'.

### Challenges
#### - Counting system. 
#### - System to move series of dots with keys.

### Outcomes
#### I aim to have a funcitonal game. One that will keep track of your score and kill you if you hit the edge.
#### I would be okay if the snake would move, the apples would respawn one eaten and the snake wouldn't be able to leave the box. Even if there's no counter, it would still be a fun pass time.

### Milestones
#### 1.Create a series of dots that appear at a random position every time you load the game
#### 2.Have the snake moving and eating the apples. Snake dies if it hits the edge?
#### 3.Have a counter that prints something like "Congrats you got (Points) Points!"
