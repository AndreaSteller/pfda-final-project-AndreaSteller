# üêçSnake

---

## Descripion
I will be making the classic google snake game through code. In this game, the player will be a 'snake' and their goal is to 'eat' as many 'apples' as they can before they run into a wall or run into themselves. In the to left is a coutner to keep track of the players score and when they die, if it's a new highscore, there's another counter towards the top middle that will update with the new highscore. 

In the future, I would like to improve the graphics, maybe make a title screen or cusomizations options. I kept the graphics simple, not only for time's sake but also so it looks like it was programmed. I like the boxy program feeling visuals that are in my game, even if the 'apple' is just a red square.
